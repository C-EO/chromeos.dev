Over the past few years, Chrome OS has been heavily investing in gaming. With Houdini integration to run ARM games and constantly improving the Android Runtime Container to enable better performance, we're committed to making Chrome OS easy to develop for and a joy to play on.

Using a game engine is a great choice for enabling game development, and we see a huge amount of developers releasing Unity games onto the Play store for consumption by Android and Chrome OS users. To best support these developers and their audiences, Google has partnered with Unity to optimize their game engine for the Chrome OS platform!

## An optimized engine for optimized games

Starting today, any developer can begin building for Chrome OS with Unity using the 2021.2 Alpha. When selecting the Android build target, developers can choose to also build for Chrome OS through the Player Settings.

Here are some highlights that we're particularly excited about:

- x86 and x86_64 build support
- Improved input support for keyboards and mice
- Window management fixes and improvements

With x86 support, developers can feel assured that nothing will get lost in translation through Houdini. Performance and stability are at their peak when you build the right ABI for the architecture.

Input and window management have often been problematic when it comes to porting an Andriod game to Chrome OS. We've been identifying all manner of mouse, keyboard, and window issues so you can worry more on making your game and less about if resizing the window is going to crash your game.

Google and Unity will be working together throughout the year to bring additional fixes and continue to improve the development experience for Chrome OS. Chrome OS support will also be backported to Unity's 2020LTS version by the end of the year. Developers targeting Chrome OS will be able to utilize the same features and toolset found in Unity's Android environment. For more details, check out [Unity's release announcement](www.unity3d.com).

No matter if your game is already made, in progress, or still an idea tumbling around in your brain, these new features and improvements will make it even easier to bring your game to Chrome OS. We can't wait to see the experiences you'll bring to Chrome OS through Unity.
